# 🛡️ SmartCheckAI

SmartCheckAI is an AI-powered misinformation detection and feedback system designed to foster information integrity, promote informed dialogue, and support peacebuilding efforts in vulnerable regions. In today’s world, misinformation spreads faster than ever, fueling conflict, deepening social divides, and undermining public trust. SmartCheckAI tackles this crisis by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, multilingual support, and a human-centered feedback loop.

## 📌 Problem Statement

In conflict-affected areas and fragile information ecosystems, false narratives spread rapidly across languages and platforms, eroding societal trust and inciting unrest. This project responds to the global challenge of misinformation by providing an intelligent, scalable tool for identifying and verifying the credibility of information in real-time.

## 🎯 What SmartCheckAI Does

✅ Detects and flags potential misinformation using multilingual AI models  
✅ Supports **multiple typologically distinct languages** common in conflict regions  
✅ Integrates a **human-in-the-loop feedback system** for community validation  
✅ Provides clear, actionable outputs including AI classifications and credibility indicators  
✅ Allows users to submit feedback on AI predictions, enabling continuous model improvement  

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multilingual AI Classification:** Classifies text content as *Real News* or *Fake News* using fine-tuned BERT-based models.
- **Feedback Dashboard:** Collects human feedback on AI classifications to improve trustworthiness.
- **Accuracy Benchmarking:** Reports model performance accuracy metrics post-training.
- **Simple and Accessible Interface:** Basic dashboard for text verification and community feedback.
- **Lightweight JSON Storage:** Feedback data stored for continuous learning iterations.

## 📊 Current Benchmark

Initial fine-tuning of the multilingual BERT model on a trimmed english dataset achieved an accuracy of **85%** after one epoch, laying the groundwork for future improvements while other languages shows bias prediction due lack dataset for model trainig which is we develop a feedback system where users will gives these data classified.

## 📌 Why It Matters

In an era where misinformation fuels crises faster than conflicts themselves, SmartCheckAI aims to empower communities with the tools to verify information, bridge linguistic divides, and promote peace through digital trust-building.
